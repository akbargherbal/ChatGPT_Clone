# Agent Changelog

## [2025-08-08]

- **Test:** Added the initial failing test case `test_read_main_serves_html` to `tests/test_main.py` to drive the development of the root endpoint. This test verifies that the endpoint returns a 200 status code and serves the main HTML file.
- **Feature:** Implemented the root endpoint in `app/main.py` to serve the `static/index.html` file. This resolves the failing test and provides the basic functionality for the web application.
